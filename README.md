# NewJetpackComposePokedex
This project is based on Philipp Lackner jetpack compose pokedex but with some changes.
The project is updated to the latest version of all component as of Q1 2023
Also this project uses Koin instead of Dagger/Hilt

The project so far is running fine but there are some todos yet.
Todos: 1 - Fix the Search Bar
       2 - Fix the dominant color pallete
       3 - Add more animations
       
Besides all that the project runs just fine on Android Electric Eel and Kotlin 1.8.10 and compose compiler 1.4.2
